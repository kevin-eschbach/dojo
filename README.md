This is a repo where I will be doing some coding challenges. I will be using this repo to learn new languages and frameworks.

## Challenges

### 1. [Ant Simulation](ant_simulation/README.md)
A simulation of ants moving around a map. The ants will follow a pheromone trail to find food. The ants will also leave a pheromone trail behind them. The pheromone trail will decay over time. Written in C++ using SFML.
